# SOLVING-GRAPH-THEORY-FOR-AUTOMATED-ELECTRIC-CIRCUIT
Graph theory plays many important roles in modern science, and in many different contexts, which span such diverse topics as the description of scale free networks, up to the structure of the universe as a complex directed graph in causal set theory.  Graph theory is also ideally suited to describe many concepts in computer science. Here we describe a project where we develop a computational approach to electric circuit solving which is based on graph theoretic concepts. This highly multi-disciplinary approach uses abstract mathematics, linear algebra &amp; computer programming, to reach the ambitious goal of implementing automated circuit solving.  In electrical engineering the word is used for edge, node for vertex and loop for circuit. Electric network analysis and synthesis are the study of network topology. Electric network problems can be represented by drawing graphs. We use the same concepts to solve the circuits.

Pioneered a python based software that takes a list of edges as an input and outputs Kirchoffs Equations and currents in independent loops.
Modeled electrical circuits as a graph and improvised a set of algorithms from branches of Graph theory and network analysis to create an end-to-end application for solving large electrical circuits with data in matrix form.
